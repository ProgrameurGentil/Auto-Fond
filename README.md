# First use 
- Put the exe file in a separate folder.
- Open the exe file.
- The application asks you to go to the settings (click on the settings button):
  - Set the folder where the wallpapers are stored. 
  - Set the default image which will have a shortcut on the application.
- Exit the settings.
- Refresh the page using the dedicated button.

> [!TIP]
> You can change the file name (which is a bit long: it's the version name) to the shorter “Auto-Fond”.
